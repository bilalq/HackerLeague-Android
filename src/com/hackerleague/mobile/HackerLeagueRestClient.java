Finally the hack also recommends you music in different years and decades.\r\n\r\n- Availabity: online, very soon.\r\n\r\nMohamed Sordo','submitted_at':'2013-04-24T13:18:21Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/music-hack-day-paris-13/hacks/popularizeme','screenshot':false,'external':'','demo':''}}]},{'id':'5159bcf61e7c94bc7900002d','name':'Hertz Mobility and Connected Vehicle','slug':'hertz-mobility-and-connected-vehicle','description':'Hertz Corporation is hosting a hackathon around Mobility and the Connected Vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe hackathon will be held on April 19th-20th and will focus on Mobility and the Connected Vehicle for the business and leisure traveler.

The idea was primarily to build an application that is unique in the sense that it has a user experience unlike any other. To demonstrate, I used eventbrites API to get events. \r\n\r\nA big distractor in exploring new cities is looking at your phone. Its dangerous, and you miss out on the exciting world around you.\r\n\r\nYou can speak to mySF and ask for an event such as a hackathon, or challege. After querying the eventbrite api, the user is presented with an event of his/her interest. The app is built and designed to be used without the need of touch, and it listens continuously and recognizes voice locally. \r\n\r\nOnce getting an event, you can ask mySF where is it about the event, or call to call a listed phone number for more information on the event. This is all being done without the need to touch the phone. \r\n\r\nUSing ESRIs GeoTrigger API, the application has been setup to take JSON from the eventbrite API for longitude and latitude. This allows the user to be notified when approaching an event.  \r\n\r\nMySF can be adapted to use any JSON feed. It is important to stress that MySF is more than just an app, its whole new experience when it comes to exploring the city or just interacting with your phone.\r\n\r\nThis application can be monetized using geolocation based audio to lead users into businesses.

Instead, they wander the internet in search of recipes where the very best they can do is to not f it up.  That doesnt make people awesome.\r\n\r\nI want to make people awesome.  Give them an environment to help them create dishes like an expert chef.  Embed knowledge of cooking techniques, ingredient compatibility and foundational templates into a site/app so that everyone can create food like someone who knows what theyre doing.  Think about how Instagram turned everyone into a decent photographer... do the same for food.\r\n\r\nProblem is that its probably pretty hard to do this in a general way, so why not test out the concept on something very simple like (wait for it) Ice Cream?\r\n\r\nSo Ice Cream Factory is an app that enables an individual with no knowledge of how to make ice cream to create thousands (millions?) of different ice cream recipes based on their whim.  Ice Cream Factory has all the knowledge to make sure things go smoothly.\r\n\r\nNOTE: while I can roughly think through how this would work, the idea is only an hour old.  Ill work on it a bit tonight, but this is really more about the process than the end product.

This amount of effort, time, and money that it takes to make the food we see online is something that can be cut down.\r\n\r\nTasty will be a site that allows users to immediately order what ingredients they need to start cooking what they want. This will be accomplished by parsing through the ingredient list posted and automatically pulling from a local (or national) online grocer so that they can select what they need and order it through our site. The online grocer would handle the storage and shipping of the ingredients after the sale is made through our site.\r\n\r\nI have discussed this idea with a few online grocers and have interest from two in DC (Urban Grocery and Relay Food) and one in San Francisco (Sustainable Produce Urban Delivery). I havent been able to find a site that does this and I think this has real market potential for the time and money it would save (on average, grocery shopping online is 10-15% cheaper than in a store) the users. Also I think this could be a cool way to work with local food markets to make healthier, more organic foods accessible to everyone. If youre interested, let me know!\r\n\r\nI am a developer and designer with more strength in UX work.

Identity verification must be performed as part of opening accounts, performing high value or high risk transactions.\r\n\r\nThe current identity verification solutions on the market rely heavily on public records and credit data. These services have the twin disadvantages of incomplete coverage (with no-hit rates as high as 30%)   and potential for false positive matches (leading to fraud losses).\r\n\r\nBy relying on trusted local service providers to do physical verification using primary identity documents, RealID ensures accurate verification and complete coverage.

Drone. \r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe AR Drone app can be a pain to use because of its software joystick that doesnt provide any tactile feedback. The xbox controller on the other hand doesnt allow you to tilt the controller as an input. I made my own controller to take advantage of the best of both. \r\n\r\nUsing an arduino, accelerometer, and joystick sensors, I created an alternative to the ARDrone Android and Iphone App. \r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Arduino microcontroller drives the controller and reads the inputs from a 3-axis accelerometer similar to what you find in phones and a 2 axis joystick  like the one from an xbox controller. Instead of having logic on the board, [Firmata](http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page) is used so that the controller can be queried and controlled directly from the computer.\r\n\r\nOn the computer, Processing uses the arduino library to read the digital and analog inputs from the controller, and then translates that data into  API calls to the AR Drone quadcopter to take off, move along 6 axis, and then land.\r\n\r\nThe result gives you the best of both worlds.\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nExtra Credit:  Use the ARDrones embedded sensors to normalize the controls to the users point of view instead of the drone, making control easier and more intuitive.

The best questions will be upvoted to the top so you as moderator have a sense of what topics the audience is most curious about.\r\n    2. No one will be shy to ask questions since our app is anonymous and secure.\r\n    3. Kale reduces the wasted time for searching for raised hands, setting up extra microphones to pass around, or waiting for people to come to the front to ask questions.\r\n    4. Kale is optimized for iPhones and Androids as well as for laptops, so everyone in the audience will be able to ask questions easily and quickly.\r\n    5. The text box for adding question is at the bottom of each event page, so audience members will read through all questions before asking their own, ensuring that theres no overlap.\r\n    6.

The full version of the recipes is saved as notes to your Evernote account (including yummy pictures). \r\n\r\nWhy are we particularly proud of what weve built?

The project could be (but is not limited to) a tool, simple web app, website, or data visualization. It is also a great opportunity to network and socialize among like-minded people. Projects will be judged by area experts, and a brief awards ceremony (with prizes courtesy of our sponsors) will conclude the program.\r\n\r\nNew to hack days? No need to fear.

As a result, it sounds lazily precise. At the other extreme, insane electronic artists like Venetian Snares spend skillions of hours tediously sequencing nuances of complex eccentric rhythms. But as a percussionist and beatboxer, eccentrically nuanced rhythms that meander in and out of polymeters come to me naturally. How can I make electronic music as easy as I can play rhythms? Python.\r\n\r\nUsing the echonest remix API (http://echonest.github.com/remix/) and scipy , I developed an improved a-from-b algorithm which uses k-means clustering on timbre data. Which makes it possible to take simple beats (kick snare hithat; or beatboxing) and layer an enslaught of samples ontop of them while preserving the ebb and flow of the rhythm, and the diversity of timbre. This could be the basis of a whole genre of electronic music. The process is highly efficient. (But it doesnt give you a licence to be lazy. Efficiency is simply an opportunity to further fine-tune your art.)\r\n\r\nhttp://cortexelation.com/labs/save-electronic-music','submitted_at':'2013-04-04T19:22:26Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackprinceton-spring-2013/hacks/save-electronic-music','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/515dd2f2baf81d677300003b/original.png?1365103356','external':'http://cortexelation.com/labs/save-electronic-music','demo':''}}]},{'id':'51464b350408593687000029','name':'HackPSU 2013','slug':'hackpsu-2013','description':'HackPSU\r\nFriday-Saturday, March 22nd-23rd, 2013\r\n\r\nHackPSU is a student-run hackathon held at Penn State University.

We want to change something in the world, and we are hungry for it.\r\n\r\n## This weekend ##\r\nOur product is an early alpha prototype. We officially began development on it 8:00PM EST 22 March 2013. Our goal this weekend was to develop a proof of concept system.\r\n\r\n## The Play ##\r\nAn NFC/Bluetooth and mobile application based content-provisioning platform to provide users with location-specific data, reduce the amount of tapping and typing on touch devices, and reduce the cost of storefront marketing for businesses.\r\n\r\nNFC combined with Bluetooth provides a hassle-free means to download content from nodes. Examples of this are the use of blink in the credit card market. We will develop a parallel use that delivers content in the form of location-specific data: (1) customer incentives, (2) X-of-the-week content, (3) mapping and touring information, and (4) a point-based system that allows users to self-actualize.\r\n\r\n We do not charge the user. \r\n\r\nOur business model generates revenue on a subscription basis. Initially, we expect to provide the subscription services and hardware at no cost to business customers in suburban/urban areas as a form of launchpad to determine the marketability of the product.\r\n\r\nWere expecting to charge 40$/month/storefront. A subscriber is provided with hardware, and establishes a service contract to maintain the hardware elements. There will be premium services available (application as a service, content as a service) for larger customers.\r\n\r\nWe expect to expand to 3000 customers over two years with a rapid growth model. Market analysis shows NFC technology is becoming more prevalent (203M mobile users w. NFC by 2014), and we expect it will eventually reach ubiquity. Finally, because the hardware device (Bluetooth+NFC Radio with ethernet) is an extremely simple integrated circuit, we expect that fabrication costs will not exceed 40$ per unit. We intend to generate 2M in revenue by late 2015.\r\n\r\nOur product targets the rapidly increasing market of NFC-enabled mobile phone users.\r\n\r\nBy adopting this service before NFC becomes a massive market we expect to gain a competitive edge in providing services. Also, we expect that the extensive hardware infrastructure will allow us to create many other service offers. \r\n\r\nOur competitors include location based business models like Foursquare, and Yelp, but we expect that our approach to the market will provide a faster, easier, and cheaper product, and also a stronger presence in users lives.','submitted_at':'2013-03-23T18:11:46Z','total_hackers':4,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackpsu-2013/hacks/dashtag','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/514df062b39996c0ef00001d/original.png?1364069381','external':'http://i.imgur.com/NCA1avj.png','demo':''}},{'id':'514e05dab39996c0ef00003e','name':'Distraction Infraction','description':'Distraction Infraction is a mobile application for Android phones.

It combines a schedule, a to-do list, and goal tracking to get you the most out of your free time. \r\n\tThe idea behind the app is that it is often hard to balance social, physical and mental activities. For example, on weeks with several exams, it’s hard to find time to work out or kick back with friends because you spend most of your time studying. Likewise, at other times it can be difficult to make the most of your free time. Balance is tailored to the user, ensuring you get the most out of your free time while taking care of your social, physical and mental needs.\r\n\tYou start by creating your schedule in the app. First you put in your immovable events, things like classes and sports practices. Once all the brick and mortar events are in place, Balance fills in all your free time with tasks and goals of yours to make sure you are getting the most of your free time. When you have an open area in your schedule, you can select that opening and Balance will give you suggestions on things you could be doing with that time.\r\n\tBalance pulls from your goals and to do list to generate these suggestions. You enter tasks and goals into Balance and rank them based on both how important they are and how much you enjoy doing them. You also enter a general time frame for each task or goal (how long it usually takes to complete that task). This allows Balance to fill in your schedule with tasks based on your interests and values and provide you with several options as to what you could be doing at that time in the categories of social, physical and mental.\r\n','submitted_at':'2013-03-23T21:24:34Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackpsu-2013/hacks/daniel-collins','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/514e1d924fd112c9a4000075/original.png?1364073886','external':'http://www.ricardomoralesmedia.com/?page_id=257','demo':'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Son-qSYy4Dc&list=UUAsyvPfg26mg47uF7nkVcuw&index=1'}},{'id':'514e24ccb39996c0ef00006c','name':'Movie Party','description':'A social gathering planner.','submitted_at':'2013-03-23T21:55:24Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackpsu-2013/hacks/movie-party','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/514e24ccb39996c0ef00006c/original.png?1364075733','external':'http://ec2-54-242-189-231.compute-1.amazonaws.com','demo':''}},{'id':'514e2079b39996c0ef000067','name':'WhatsLive','description':'Our phone app for finding/managing parties.

Therefore, it is difficult to observe where redundancies in services are happening and where collaboration between complementary services can be fostered.  \r\n2) Populations in need are not able to easily search all services available to solve the problems they are afflicted with everyday. \r\n\r\nProject Solution\r\nWe have created a project, which has mapped every nonprofit within Massachusetts (this has never been done before).  This map is interactive, and the user is able to effectively visualize the entire nonprofit sector segmented by the service they are providing.  We believe this map will allow users to observe larger nonprofit trends within regions, and provide information on where service redundancies are happening relative to needs.  Additionally, we have integrated a cell scraping platform to this map, which functions as both a data collector and a query search engine i.e. a client texts in a need, such as homeless.  This need appears on the large map in an  aggregated heat map for future analyses.  From this text, the user receives all services directed to homeless populations within a 5 mile radius.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this project allows nonprofits to reach a greater user base, and clientele to have more effective access to services.
