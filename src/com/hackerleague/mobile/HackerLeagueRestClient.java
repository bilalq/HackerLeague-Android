The Contest is open and limited to students who are enrolled in an undergraduate institution within the United States.\r\n\r\nHow can you use digital technology to develop an application that transforms education? For inspiration, weve provided a view example ideas that might get you thinking about the possibilities of what you could build:\r\n\r\n* **Mobile Applications:** Build a tablet or phone application for students, teachers, administrators, or learners of all ages. \r\n* **Time-saving tools:** Both students and teachers are pressed for time. Can you build an application that allows teachers or students to be more efficient, to learn or complete tasks outside of the physical or virtual classroom?\r\n* **Learning & Retention:** Can you build an immersive, fun, collaborative experience to engage students, promote learning and retention, personalize education, or promote social learning?\r\n* **Utilizing Technology:** What non-traditional educational technologies might you integrate with an on-line learning experience. Would you use your X-Box to submit a homework assignment?\r\n\r\nWhen \r\n-----\r\nBegin submitting your idea on September 3, 2013 through September 30, 2013. Contestants will be notified by October 4, 2013 if their idea has been accepted. Contests must submit their final work by November 30, 2013. Winning submission will be announced on December 30, 2013.

Przez 8h można zrobić działającą makietę większego projektu lub projekt, który rozwiązuje mały problem. Być może któryś z projektów okaże się być zalążkiem startup’u na miarę Facebooka :)\r\n\r\nPodczas 8h można będzie wymienić doświadczenia między ludźmi, na co dzień pracującymi w różnych firmach, być może w innych metodologiach lub z innymi technologiami.\r\n\r\nHackathon będzie składał się z trzech etapów:\r\n\r\n* Propozycja tematów\r\n\r\n* Praca nad jednym z wybranych projektów\r\n\r\n* Prezentacja efektów\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n9:30 - 10:00 - Śniadanie\r\n\r\n10:00 - 10:05 - Oficjalne rozpoczęcie\r\n\r\n10:05 - 10:30 - Prezentacja tematów i tworzenie zespołów\r\n\r\n10:30 - 13:30 - Praca projektowa\r\n\r\n13:30 - 14:00 - Lunch\r\n\r\n10:00 - 18:00 - Praca projektowa\r\n\r\n18:00 - 18:30 - Prezentacja projektów i wyłonienie zwycięskiego zespołu\r\n\r\n19:00 - …. - After party w Piwotece :)\r\n\r\nPropozycja tematów\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nJako uczestnik Hackathonu możesz zaproponować temat projektu, nad którym chciałbyś/ałabyś pracować. Jeśli natomiast wolisz rozwijać jeden spośród projektów zaproponowanych przez innych dołącz do tego zespołu. Osoby, które zgłoszą temat projektu na Hackaton (używając hacker league), będą mieć 5 min na prezentację swojego pomysłu (najlepiej przygotować prezentacje, by zachęcić więcej osób do swojego pomysłu), można sprawdzić swoje umiejętności przekonywania innych. Im więcej przekonanych uczestników, tym większy będzie zespół i potencjalnie większe szanse na udany projekt. Dobrze, jeśli zwerbuje się też grafika wtedy projekt ma szansę wyglądać estetycznie :).\r\n\r\n\r\nTworzenie zespołów:\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nJeśli masz kolegów/koleżanki, z którymi chciałabyś/ałabyś stworzyć projekt możecie zgłosić cały zespół wcześniej dzięki aplikacji hackerleague. Jeśli nie masz zespołu, nie przejmuj się ponieważ znaczna część uczestników tworzyć będzie zespoły ad hoc zgodnie z preferencjami dotyczącymi przedstawionych projektów.\r\n\r\nJęzyk programowania jest dowolny, jeśli Twój projekt chcesz oprzeć na php czy ruby to nie ma problemu :). Prawdopodobnie to nawet lepszy wybór jako że projekt należy rozwinąć w jeden dzień.\r\nPraca\r\n\r\nPracujemy na własnych laptopach.\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nZapisz się, jeśli lubisz, chcesz programować i spróbować swoich sił w tym Hackathonie.\r\nPrezentacja efektów\r\n\r\nByć może nie uda się dokończyć projektu, ale nic nie stoi na przeszkodzie, żeby kontynuować pracę nad nim nawet po zakończeniu hackatonu.\r\n\r\nPrezentacja efektów ma na celu sprawdzenie, co udało się zrobić w tak krótkim czasie oraz wyłonienie najlepszego zespołu, który zostaje zwycięzcą Hackathonu.\r\n\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://8ea91784-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/juglodz/hackathon/plakat_hackat_20_04_2013.jpg?attachauth=ANoY7cqbzxGCxsPxNihYddwvtnlzQ82NtxvpHBdNJZdPbuZ_lToeKYMnPaOP8lG-YX5fgB0DqkSSoWrPkrPZryig3Qkjrw-Ox_l2ZaN16dzoyKxgoOy2t3FtOUuLqPZSacnFaxxvb4TbJSMGDW25m1_kAhg4skqMP3rRBKTXuQ6svq3XsxKgHYhKIwzM4Jjuwpe7KmWgxGIjtBkU3VeTHN4CaVHVzlepH9dWmmLcpwb3zXx5PHA_zOI%3D&attredirects=0 Title)','external_url':'','state':'pending','start_time':'2013-09-28T19:00:00Z','end_time':'2013-09-28T17:00:00Z','logo':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/organizations/logos/512e6b24771fe1533000002c/original.png?1361996578','students_only':false,'total_hackers':25,'total_hacks':2,'location':{'city':'Łódź','state':'łódzkie','country':'Polska'},'url':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/lodz-hackathon-2013','hacks':[{'id':'514d48e4b39996c0ef000002','name':'Mobilization app','description':'Potrzebuje aplikacji mobilnej na mobilization.\r\nCos co zastapi speakermeter application\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.mobilization.speakermeter\r\n\r\nZasada działania:\r\nNa heroku jest już backend ruby który serwuje jsona. \r\nTo wszystko należy zaprezentować w aplikacji.\r\n\r\nDokładnie tak samo jak w speakermeter app tylko chciałbym usprawnić sposób prezentacji danych.\r\n\r\nBackend ruby wymaga trochę zmian, klient androidowy pewnie do przepisania.\r\n\r\nDodatkowo chciałbym dodać featury typu twitter FB czy google plus.\r\n\r\nPotrzeby:\r\n- grafik\r\n- dwóch androidowców (w tym ja)','submitted_at':'2013-03-23T06:17:08Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/lodz-hackathon-2013/hacks/mobilization-app','screenshot':false,'external':'','demo':''}},{'id':'516740ae56004399b000001e','name':'Spotify Remote Controll','description':'Nie wiem jak to wygląda u was ale mój laptop/PC jest jednocześnie moim centrum rozrywki, odtwarza muzykę, filmy itd. a czasem służy też do kodowania ;)\r\n\r\nJednak od czasu do czasu, gdy jestem z dala od laptopa a z głośników zaczyna lecieć utwór którego nie znoszę, a który z jakiś przyczyn pozostał na dysku to rzucam wszystko i biegnę do klawiatury, aby jak najszybciej przełączyć na następny utwór.

Friend on the go will allow people to connect with other commuters based on similar commute time, bart station, similar interests and more. Currently, our app is at the proof of concept stage.\r\n\r\nProblem: \r\nThere is valuable time that is lost during commute with driving a car. In addition, congestion often leads to high stress environments to drivers. Furthermore, cities  often foster alienated communities. Our app is designed to alleviate these problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nVision: \r\nWe combine the features of already existing services and apps, such as  Facebook, LinkedIn and Skillswap to collects users interests and friends database. Users of similar interests can now meet up. Imagine fellow Cleanweb hackers are taking the same train together, but unaware of this. Our app will provide them the opportunity to collaborate. Finally, we build features of security and reliability. We allow riders to gain ranking based on frequency of usage of our app and allow riders to rate [approval/disapproval] of other fellow riders.\r\n\r\nAudience: \r\nPrimary appeal to existing bikers and riders of public transportation. This implies that our app need to attract younger audience to obtain critical mass. Also existing drivers may switch to public transportation (business opportunities may be most appealing).  \r\n\r\nOther Impacts besides social:\r\nEnvironment: \r\nExisting Users of public transportation will enjoy the social impacts, such that even if they have enough income to purchase a car, they will continue to pursue public transportation. And, of course switchers.\r\n\r\nSafety:\r\nDuring late night trips, public transportation may be rather unsafe. Friends in the Go will provide reliable partners to ride with you.\r\n\r\nCommunity:\r\nOften many riders will be coming from the same community. This is an excellent opportunity to meet your fellow neighbors. Thus strengthening community bonds.\r\n\r\nCollaborators: Julian Tai, Abu Nayeem, Mrinalini Manandhar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','submitted_at':'2013-04-28T00:44:57Z','total_hackers':2,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/berkeley-cleanweb-hackathon/hacks/friends-on-the-go','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/517c7109754c24b04500002d/original.png?1367187707','external':'https://github.com/juliantai/hackathon_berkeley','demo':''}},{'id':'517c6e40754c24b04500002b','name':'Green Button Grade','description':'Making sense of GreenButton data.

Despite the recent wave of digital disruption and innovation that has swept over communication and identification technologies, the funding and exchange of goods, the design and manufacturing of objects and desires in urban life, digital technologies have yet to similarly transform much of the structural conditions and character of the spaces we inhabit every day. This hackathon invites technologists to upend architecture, to bring the spaces we inhabit and how we inhabit them into the 21st century.\r\n\r\nFrom atmospheres of sound, light and air, to property ownership, discovery and sharing, to design processes, procurement and compensation, to development investment, execution and marketing, to neighborhood planning, organization and communal living, the habitat presents a broad spectrum of variables for hacking away at, into and through the lived environment. As part of the [New Museum’s Ideas City festival](http://www.ideas-city.org/), rather than hacking the API of a nascent digital platform, framework, library or product, we will provide physical space, a habitat to be hacked.\r\n\r\nThe house as API:\r\nFor the Hackathon, teams will be given the designs for a building proposed for New York City to think through and prototype means of using new design methodologies and technologies to re-invent domestic habitats. We invite hackers of hardware and software, as well as architects and designers to design and develop new elements to plug in to, augment, support and disrupt the technological apparatus of a home, ranging from physical space to communication, exchange, sharing and any other element of domestic living, whether physical or virtual.\r\n\r\nAll parties interested in contributing to the new habitat are welcome to join us for a two-day hackathon on April 27-28 at the [New Lab in the Brooklyn Navy Yards](http://newlab.com/news-blog/2013/3/28/new-lab-featured-in-fast-company). Teams will present their ideas for disrupting habitats to a jury of technologists, visionaries, architects, decision makers at the end of the second day to receive feedback on their ideas and presentations. They will then have a public stage to present during the New Museum’s Ideas City Festival on Friday, May 3.\r\n\r\nFor more details contact: newerhabitat@gmail.com','external_url':'http://new-habit.at','state':'complete','start_time':'2013-04-27T14:00:00Z','end_time':'2013-04-28T23:00:00Z','logo':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/organizations/logos/51709bdc0171e86b5100000a/original.png?1366334426','students_only':false,'total_hackers':12,'total_hacks':1,'location':{'city':'Brooklyn','state':'NY','country':'United States'},'url':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/new-habitat-number-hackcity','hacks':[{'id':'51780ee10037d7766e000052','name':'Virtual Arquitecture','description':'A building owner submits a project online with drawings and construction documents and virtual collaborators review and design a prototype of the building.

This means backing up either with mongodump or backing up the MongoDB data files  directly and adding the ability to backup to OpenStack storage in addition to the existing options which include local disk, SFTP, SCP, RSync, Dropbox, etc.\r\nhttps://github.com/meskyanichi/backup/pull/415\r\nhttps://github.com/meskyanichi/backup/pull/439\r\n\r\nAbout Backup\r\n-------------\r\nBackup is a utility, written for UNIX-like operating systems, that allows you to easily perform backup operations on both your remote, as well as your local environment. It provides you with an elegant DSL for configuring your backups. Backup has built-in support for various databases, storage protocols/services, syncers, compressors, encryptors and notifiers which you can mix and match. It was built with modularity, extensibility and simplicity in mind.\r\n\r\nWith Backup, you have a highly configurable and tested solution ready to go. E.g. you could configure Backup to compress your MongoDB files, split them into 4GB chunks, upload them to SoftLayer object storage, and notify you by email when the backup is complete.\r\n\r\n    Backup::Model.new(:mongodb_backup, MongoDB backup configuration) do\r\n    \r\n      split_into_chunks_of 4000\r\n    \r\n      database MongoDB do |db|\r\n        db.name               = connectifier\r\n        db.host               = localhost\r\n        db.port               = 27017\r\n        db.ipv6               = false\r\n        db.lock               = true\r\n      end\r\n    \r\n      compress_with Gzip\r\n\r\n      notify_by Mail do |mail|\r\n        mail.on_success           = true\r\n        mail.on_warning           = true\r\n        mail.on_failure           = true\r\n        mail.from                 = sender@email.com\r\n        mail.to                   = receiver@email.com\r\n        mail.address              = smtp.gmail.com\r\n        mail.port                 = 587\r\n        mail.domain               = your.host.name\r\n        mail.user_name            = sender@email.com\r\n        mail.password             = my_password\r\n        mail.authentication       = plain\r\n        mail.enable_starttls_auto = true\r\n      end\r\n\r\n    end','submitted_at':'2013-03-08T06:16:59Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/mongodb-march-madness/hacks/meskyanichi-slash-backup','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/5139825b0575871088000013/original.png?1362723718','external':'https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup','demo':''}},{'id':'514d84174fd112c9a4000002','name':'Robomongo.app (OS X)','description':'Documentation and packaging for a Robomongo OS X standalone **Robomongo.app**.\r\n\r\nRobomongo is an open source cross-platform MongoDB management tool: http://www.robomongo.org/.\r\n\r\nBinaries and installer are currently only available for Windows.','submitted_at':'2013-03-23T10:29:43Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/mongodb-march-madness/hacks/robomongo-dot-app-os-x','screenshot':false,'external':'','demo':''}},{'id':'51658ab8e2052b80ab00000c','name':'Selene','description':'A simple CMS for blogging built with Tornado and MongoDB.\r\n\r\nCore features\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n* Responsive UI with Twitter-Bootstrap.\r\n* Customizable theming.\r\n* Text types for posting:\r\n   * Text plain\r\n   * HTML\r\n   * Markdown\r\n   * reStructuredText\r\n   * BBCode\r\n   * Textile\r\n* Posts sharing via Google+, Twitter and Facebook.\r\n* Optional comments management via Disqus.\r\n* Supported localization:\r\n   * Arabic (ar_AR)\r\n   * German (de_DE)\r\n   * English (en_US)\r\n   * Spanish (es_ES)\r\n   * French (fr_FR)\r\n   * Japanese (ja_JP)\r\n   * Macedonian (mk_MK)\r\n   * Chinese Simplified (zh_CN)\r\n   * Chinese Traditional (zh_HK, zh_TW)\r\n* Support for Google Analytics and Gravatar.\r\n* Customizable search for publications using regular expressions or full text\r\n  search.\r\n\r\n* For this project we have considered to move all MongoDB operations from PyMongo to Motor, the asynchronous Python driver for Tornado, any changes regarding this can be found in a branch named motor.\r\n','submitted_at':'2013-04-10T15:52:25Z','total_hackers':3,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/mongodb-march-madness/hacks/selene','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/51658ab8e2052b80ab00000c/original.png?1365609162','external':'https://github.com/puentesarrin/selene','demo':''}},{'id':'5146c13e7cddad0d7d000007','name':'NoSQL Test Results Repository','description':'Tool to collect YCSB performance test results into MongoDB.\r\nWeb UI to find, view and compare different test results and draw comparison charts.','submitted_at':'2013-03-18T07:24:46Z','total_hackers':3,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/mongodb-march-madness/hacks/nosql-test-results-repository','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/5146c13e7cddad0d7d000007/original.png?1366445708','external':'https://github.com/thumbtack-technology/NoSQL-Test-Results-Repository','demo':''}},{'id':'51523f9a5d2e9c64dd00001f','name':'Leafblower','description':'![Leafblower logo](https://raw.github.com/rdrkt/leafblower/master/www/apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png) Leafblower\r\n============================\r\n\r\nLeafblower is an open source, easily extensible, flexible and live dashboarding platform.

The idea was primarily to build an application that is unique in the sense that it has a user experience unlike any other. To demonstrate, I used eventbrites API to get events. \r\n\r\nA big distractor in exploring new cities is looking at your phone. Its dangerous, and you miss out on the exciting world around you.\r\n\r\nYou can speak to mySF and ask for an event such as a hackathon, or challege. After querying the eventbrite api, the user is presented with an event of his/her interest. The app is built and designed to be used without the need of touch, and it listens continuously and recognizes voice locally. \r\n\r\nOnce getting an event, you can ask mySF where is it about the event, or call to call a listed phone number for more information on the event. This is all being done without the need to touch the phone. \r\n\r\nUSing ESRIs GeoTrigger API, the application has been setup to take JSON from the eventbrite API for longitude and latitude. This allows the user to be notified when approaching an event.  \r\n\r\nMySF can be adapted to use any JSON feed. It is important to stress that MySF is more than just an app, its whole new experience when it comes to exploring the city or just interacting with your phone.\r\n\r\nThis application can be monetized using geolocation based audio to lead users into businesses.

People travelling by car on highways are easy victims of criminals.\r\nBy choosing a safe route for travel one could avoid being a victim of thefts etc.\r\nBon Voyage is an app made for Android Platform that works by taking source and destination from users giving them the safest route to destination by profiling the crime rates on all the available paths to destination.\r\nThis app will also display the crime rates and distance on all the possible paths enabling the user to select appropriate path according to their preference.  \r\nGiven a source and destination by the user on an Android device, our app gives the safest path by profiling the crime rates of all the available routes.\r\n\r\nThe User is asked to enter source and destination address. This address is converted to a JSON Object from which latitude and longitude is retrieved. Based on these coordinates all the possible paths are displayed to the user. Along with the path distance required to be traveled using a path is displayed. Along with it the crime rates corresponding to that path is also displayed. These crime rates are calculated by dividing a path into different intervals and using those coordinates calculating the crime rates around it. \r\nUser is given an option to select a route based on his preference.\r\n\r\nThe crime related data is seeded from SpotCrime API and the distance calculation is accomplished by using Google Maps API.\r\n\r\nCurrently we have designed the application only for Android phones.','submitted_at':'2013-04-14T15:31:07Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/ub-hacking-2013/hacks/bon-voyage','screenshot':false,'external':'','demo':''}},{'id':'516aebfa2c9ae305da000103','name':'FitOMeter','description':'FitOMeter is an integrated body scale.

Instead, they wander the internet in search of recipes where the very best they can do is to not f it up.  That doesnt make people awesome.\r\n\r\nI want to make people awesome.  Give them an environment to help them create dishes like an expert chef.  Embed knowledge of cooking techniques, ingredient compatibility and foundational templates into a site/app so that everyone can create food like someone who knows what theyre doing.  Think about how Instagram turned everyone into a decent photographer... do the same for food.\r\n\r\nProblem is that its probably pretty hard to do this in a general way, so why not test out the concept on something very simple like (wait for it) Ice Cream?\r\n\r\nSo Ice Cream Factory is an app that enables an individual with no knowledge of how to make ice cream to create thousands (millions?) of different ice cream recipes based on their whim.  Ice Cream Factory has all the knowledge to make sure things go smoothly.\r\n\r\nNOTE: while I can roughly think through how this would work, the idea is only an hour old.  Ill work on it a bit tonight, but this is really more about the process than the end product.

This amount of effort, time, and money that it takes to make the food we see online is something that can be cut down.\r\n\r\nTasty will be a site that allows users to immediately order what ingredients they need to start cooking what they want. This will be accomplished by parsing through the ingredient list posted and automatically pulling from a local (or national) online grocer so that they can select what they need and order it through our site. The online grocer would handle the storage and shipping of the ingredients after the sale is made through our site.\r\n\r\nI have discussed this idea with a few online grocers and have interest from two in DC (Urban Grocery and Relay Food) and one in San Francisco (Sustainable Produce Urban Delivery). I havent been able to find a site that does this and I think this has real market potential for the time and money it would save (on average, grocery shopping online is 10-15% cheaper than in a store) the users.

RealID leverages a network of trusted third party service providers - such as notaries, local attorneys and accountants - to verify the real identity of customers. \r\n\r\nRealID allows institutional customers to better serve online and mobile only customers comply with KYC (Know your customer) and CIP (Customer Identification program) regulations without requiring them to staff up a large offline operation for identity verification. Identity verification must be performed as part of opening accounts, performing high value or high risk transactions.\r\n\r\nThe current identity verification solutions on the market rely heavily on public records and credit data. These services have the twin disadvantages of incomplete coverage (with no-hit rates as high as 30%)   and potential for false positive matches (leading to fraud losses).\r\n\r\nBy relying on trusted local service providers to do physical verification using primary identity documents, RealID ensures accurate verification and complete coverage.

It is difficult (impossible) to access computer readable data on city level carbon emissions data. Most local governments currently report carbon inventory results in a non-standard PDF report on a government website. Seventeen local governments in the US have reported standardized community emissions data to the Carbon Disclosure Project, but these data are not open.\r\n\r\nWhats the Solution? Make it as easy as possible for local governments across the world to share their communitys emissions information in a standardized format. Open computer-readable data encourages reuse and remixing of the information.\r\n\r\nIMPACT: Cities contribute 70-80% of carbon emissions globally. The way cities measure and manage their carbon emissions is critical. The Open Carbon standard will enable anyone to understand their citys emissions and encourage data-driven innovations.\r\n\r\nFor more info see: \r\n\r\nhttp://opencarbon.org/\r\nhttp://opencarbon.org/charts.html\r\nhttps://github.com/factorypreset/opencarbon','submitted_at':'2013-04-05T12:55:50Z','total_hackers':2,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/boston-cleanweb-hackathon-2-dot-0/hacks/open-carbon-cities','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/515ec9d6baf81d67730000b2/original.png?1365359058','external':'http://opencarbon.org/','demo':''}},{'id':'5160214a32a3c28bf200025f','name':'SimEnergy','description':'A game focused on improving energy efficiency in Boston based on SimCity.','submitted_at':'2013-04-06T13:21:14Z','total_hackers':4,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/boston-cleanweb-hackathon-2-dot-0/hacks/simenergy','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/5160214a32a3c28bf200025f/original.png?1365254602','external':'http://54.225.233.243','demo':''}},{'id':'51603558c61db33f0f00001e','name':'JCubic','description':'An energy usage monitoring tool for the City of Boston that incorporates potential savings.

Instead of having logic on the board, [Firmata](http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page) is used so that the controller can be queried and controlled directly from the computer.\r\n\r\nOn the computer, Processing uses the arduino library to read the digital and analog inputs from the controller, and then translates that data into  API calls to the AR Drone quadcopter to take off, move along 6 axis, and then land.\r\n\r\nThe result gives you the best of both worlds.\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nExtra Credit:  Use the ARDrones embedded sensors to normalize the controls to the users point of view instead of the drone, making control easier and more intuitive.

We use the tropo API to collect the data from your call and mash it up with the data from your shopping list in Evernote (accessed via the Evernote API) and recipe data from yummly.com (the worlds largest recipe site).\r\nBased on this data we make three recipe suggestions by text message (via tropo) that make the best use of what you already have on your shopping list / inside your fridge.\r\nThe text message contains the recipe names and the additionally required items for your shopping list. The full version of the recipes is saved as notes to your Evernote account (including yummy pictures). \r\n\r\nWhy are we particularly proud of what weve built?

The game can run online, in a Windows 8 app, in an Android app, and in an iOS app.','submitted_at':'2013-03-31T13:44:07Z','total_hackers':4,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackru-spring2013/hacks/mines-with-friends','screenshot':false,'external':'','demo':''}},{'id':'5158438960a81f6fd2000022','name':'Have I Downloaded This Before?','description':'Keep your downloads folder clean by preventing duplicates.\r\n\r\nThe source is available here: https://github.com/yefim323/Have-I-Downloaded-This-Before','submitted_at':'2013-03-31T14:09:13Z','total_hackers':3,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackru-spring2013/hacks/have-i-downloaded-this-before','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/5158438960a81f6fd2000022/original.png?1364745039','external':'https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apjambapclnlphnllchfdlmhaijeamah','demo':''}},{'id':'5158447260a81f6fd2000024','name':'YOLO!','description':'You only live once, so might as well make a arduino powered yoyo.','submitted_at':'2013-03-31T14:13:06Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackru-spring2013/hacks/yolo','screenshot':false,'external':'','demo':''}},{'id':'515844af60a81f6fd2000025','name':'Rutgers Calendar Sync','description':'Scrapes class registration data from WebReg and exports to iCalendar syntax (which can be uploaded to Google Calendar).\r\n\r\nwith David Awad','submitted_at':'2013-03-31T14:14:07Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackru-spring2013/hacks/rutgers-calendar-sync','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/515844af60a81f6fd2000025/original.png?1364744745','external':'https://gist.github.com/SpinfusorNet/5281051#file-bookmarklet','demo':''}},{'id':'5158452860a81f6fd2000028','name':'SlamJam','description':'Control VLC via an arduino with a knock sensor and a python script.','submitted_at':'2013-03-31T14:16:08Z','total_hackers':4,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackru-spring2013/hacks/slamjam','screenshot':false,'external':'','demo':''}},{'id':'515845f560a81f6fd200002d','name':'iAMAggregator','description':'Brows reddit AMAs with only the relevant questions and answers displayed.','submitted_at':'2013-03-31T14:19:33Z','total_hackers':2,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackru-spring2013/hacks/iamaggregator','screenshot':false,'external':'','demo':''}},{'id':'5157a800dbde618a3a00016f','name':'LightTrack','description':'Webcam tracks motion of an Arduino with a blinking LED.

The fun gaming element is to allow users the ability to do one of three things: Play (add song), Stop (remove song) or Record (share/prop song) to a location or person. Therefore, communities of friends can curate songs that remind them of each other or you can duke it out with strangers for the best fit song for a particular location. Think of it as a more intimate and mobile version of turntable.fm but with a friend/location twist.\r\n\r\nThis product would be most amazing if integrated with foursquare, facebook and spotify.

The project could be (but is not limited to) a tool, simple web app, website, or data visualization. It is also a great opportunity to network and socialize among like-minded people. Projects will be judged by area experts, and a brief awards ceremony (with prizes courtesy of our sponsors) will conclude the program.\r\n\r\nNew to hack days? No need to fear.

As a result, it sounds lazily precise. At the other extreme, insane electronic artists like Venetian Snares spend skillions of hours tediously sequencing nuances of complex eccentric rhythms. But as a percussionist and beatboxer, eccentrically nuanced rhythms that meander in and out of polymeters come to me naturally. How can I make electronic music as easy as I can play rhythms? Python.\r\n\r\nUsing the echonest remix API (http://echonest.github.com/remix/) and scipy , I developed an improved a-from-b algorithm which uses k-means clustering on timbre data. Which makes it possible to take simple beats (kick snare hithat; or beatboxing) and layer an enslaught of samples ontop of them while preserving the ebb and flow of the rhythm, and the diversity of timbre. This could be the basis of a whole genre of electronic music. The process is highly efficient. (But it doesnt give you a licence to be lazy. Efficiency is simply an opportunity to further fine-tune your art.)\r\n\r\nhttp://cortexelation.com/labs/save-electronic-music','submitted_at':'2013-04-04T19:22:26Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackprinceton-spring-2013/hacks/save-electronic-music','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/515dd2f2baf81d677300003b/original.png?1365103356','external':'http://cortexelation.com/labs/save-electronic-music','demo':''}}]},{'id':'513a339401b66c6bb400002b','name':'Radisson Hackathon','slug':'radisson-hackathon','description':'To Register: http://www.radissonhackathon.com/\r\nRegistration closes on March 12, 2013 11:59:59pm PT. \r\n\r\nTuesday, March 26, 2013 \r\n8:00 AM - 6:00 PM (Pacific Time)\r\n\r\nMoscone Convention Center\r\nGame Developers Conference\r\n747 Howard Street\r\nRoom 3020, West Hall J\r\nSan Francisco, California 94103\r\nUnited States \r\n\r\nRadisson Hackathon\r\n==============================================\r\nRadisson® hotels is looking to team up with the top talents in gaming development to create an engaging new simulation game creatively themed around some aspects of the hotel business.

We want to change something in the world, and we are hungry for it.\r\n\r\n## This weekend ##\r\nOur product is an early alpha prototype. We officially began development on it 8:00PM EST 22 March 2013. Our goal this weekend was to develop a proof of concept system.\r\n\r\n## The Play ##\r\nAn NFC/Bluetooth and mobile application based content-provisioning platform to provide users with location-specific data, reduce the amount of tapping and typing on touch devices, and reduce the cost of storefront marketing for businesses.\r\n\r\nNFC combined with Bluetooth provides a hassle-free means to download content from nodes. Examples of this are the use of blink in the credit card market. We will develop a parallel use that delivers content in the form of location-specific data: (1) customer incentives, (2) X-of-the-week content, (3) mapping and touring information, and (4) a point-based system that allows users to self-actualize.\r\n\r\n We do not charge the user. \r\n\r\nOur business model generates revenue on a subscription basis. Initially, we expect to provide the subscription services and hardware at no cost to business customers in suburban/urban areas as a form of launchpad to determine the marketability of the product.\r\n\r\nWere expecting to charge 40$/month/storefront. A subscriber is provided with hardware, and establishes a service contract to maintain the hardware elements. There will be premium services available (application as a service, content as a service) for larger customers.\r\n\r\nWe expect to expand to 3000 customers over two years with a rapid growth model. Market analysis shows NFC technology is becoming more prevalent (203M mobile users w. NFC by 2014), and we expect it will eventually reach ubiquity. Finally, because the hardware device (Bluetooth+NFC Radio with ethernet) is an extremely simple integrated circuit, we expect that fabrication costs will not exceed 40$ per unit. We intend to generate 2M in revenue by late 2015.\r\n\r\nOur product targets the rapidly increasing market of NFC-enabled mobile phone users.\r\n\r\nBy adopting this service before NFC becomes a massive market we expect to gain a competitive edge in providing services. Also, we expect that the extensive hardware infrastructure will allow us to create many other service offers. \r\n\r\nOur competitors include location based business models like Foursquare, and Yelp, but we expect that our approach to the market will provide a faster, easier, and cheaper product, and also a stronger presence in users lives.','submitted_at':'2013-03-23T18:11:46Z','total_hackers':4,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackpsu-2013/hacks/dashtag','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/514df062b39996c0ef00001d/original.png?1364069381','external':'http://i.imgur.com/NCA1avj.png','demo':''}},{'id':'514e05dab39996c0ef00003e','name':'Distraction Infraction','description':'Distraction Infraction is a mobile application for Android phones.

It combines a schedule, a to-do list, and goal tracking to get you the most out of your free time. \r\n\tThe idea behind the app is that it is often hard to balance social, physical and mental activities. For example, on weeks with several exams, it’s hard to find time to work out or kick back with friends because you spend most of your time studying. Likewise, at other times it can be difficult to make the most of your free time. Balance is tailored to the user, ensuring you get the most out of your free time while taking care of your social, physical and mental needs.\r\n\tYou start by creating your schedule in the app. First you put in your immovable events, things like classes and sports practices. Once all the brick and mortar events are in place, Balance fills in all your free time with tasks and goals of yours to make sure you are getting the most of your free time. When you have an open area in your schedule, you can select that opening and Balance will give you suggestions on things you could be doing with that time.\r\n\tBalance pulls from your goals and to do list to generate these suggestions. You enter tasks and goals into Balance and rank them based on both how important they are and how much you enjoy doing them. You also enter a general time frame for each task or goal (how long it usually takes to complete that task). This allows Balance to fill in your schedule with tasks based on your interests and values and provide you with several options as to what you could be doing at that time in the categories of social, physical and mental.\r\n','submitted_at':'2013-03-23T21:24:34Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackpsu-2013/hacks/daniel-collins','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/514e1d924fd112c9a4000075/original.png?1364073886','external':'http://www.ricardomoralesmedia.com/?page_id=257','demo':'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Son-qSYy4Dc&list=UUAsyvPfg26mg47uF7nkVcuw&index=1'}},{'id':'514e24ccb39996c0ef00006c','name':'Movie Party','description':'A social gathering planner.','submitted_at':'2013-03-23T21:55:24Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackpsu-2013/hacks/movie-party','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/514e24ccb39996c0ef00006c/original.png?1364075733','external':'http://ec2-54-242-189-231.compute-1.amazonaws.com','demo':''}},{'id':'514e2079b39996c0ef000067','name':'WhatsLive','description':'Our phone app for finding/managing parties.

Our hackathon presents an opportunity to experiment with mobile application development platforms, APIs, and “smart” devices and to address an array of possible projects falling loosely into three broad categories:\r\n\r\nSocial Good Challenge - Mobile apps and social media are bringing opportunity and aid in ways we could not have imaged. Can you develop an app that helps improve the quality of life for people in war-torn, drought or hunger-stricken communities? We have prizes for teams willing to take the challenge and build applications for good!\r\n\r\nSmarter Living Challenge – Using motion, voice, and other sensory data, and combining them with cloud-based data sources (from social media streams and other feeds), the goal is to help people be more responsive and sensitive toward one another and make better use of the technology that surrounds them. Whether for connected vehicles, wearable computing, home automation, toys, travel, entertainment, or shopping, these apps come together in a dramatic real-world road test that you will not want to miss! Educational apps for early childhood through to continuing adult and elderly education; apps for patients, healthcare practitioners, medical facilities, and healthcare payers; and social services apps for utilities, carriers, governments, and non-profits revolutionizing the way basic services are delivered to the most advanced and to the most needy people on the planet.\r\n\r\nSustainable Business Challenge – Just like governments and human rights groups, companies are also trying to make life better for their employees and their customers. By making mundane business tasks more like games, employers can improve customer loyalty and employee satisfaction. This challenge aims to make the workplace more productive, more efficient, and more fun. The concepts behind many of the most popular consumer apps and games can be applied in enterprise environments to promote employee engagement, workforce productivity, quality control, accountability, health and environmental safety.\r\n\r\nCollaboration is key to success in a Hackathon and that fact has not gone unnoticed by governments wishing to foster the exchange of innovation and ideas between and among different countries around the globe. In addition to the three general themes and the independent challenges set forth by our technology sponsors, each event includes recognition and reward for individuals who distinguish themselves during the event in learning, exploration, sharing, building, and mastery. \r\n\r\nFor more information on how you can participate and win please follow the link below:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hackthehackathon.com/event/hth-istanbul-08mar2013/\r\n\r\n','external_url':'','state':'complete','start_time':'2013-03-08T23:00:00Z','end_time':'2013-03-10T22:00:00Z','logo':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/organizations/logos/511ab2415e44c0504a00000a/original.jpg?1360704063','students_only':false,'total_hackers':1,'total_hacks':0,'location':{'city':'Istanbul','state':'Istanbul','country':'Turkey'},'url':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hack-the-hackathon-istanbul','hacks':[]},{'id':'512fccd9fcfda72bf900003a','name':'#blackhack Hollywood @ SXSW','slug':'number-blackhack-hollywood-at-sxsw','description':'#blackhack Hollywood is a hackathon for the black tech community across the country, gathered together at SXSW.

Theyll get another response with a snapshot of how theyve been doing.\r\n\r\nCounselors can be part of this as well. They can review an admin page that shows all the clients theyve set up, their goals and how consistent theyve been at making contributions.  In one click, a counselor can send a text reminder to all the clients who, say, are making contributions on fewer than 50% of their paychecks, to proactively ask if theyd like to schedule an appointment.\r\n\r\nThis is a PHP application built using jquerymobile and Twillio for texting.  Most clients have access to cell phones with basic text messaging – so we’re using that as the primary means of communication. But they’re also very busy, so on the go, they can get a quick reminder away from the computer.','submitted_at':'2013-03-03T16:28:58Z','total_hackers':1,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/financial-empowerment-hackathon/hacks/pay-yourself-first','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/51337a4adf127a1eee00006e/original.png?1362328151','external':'http://www.cnvrge.com/ofe/','demo':false}},{'id':'51339f697cf1d315fd00006e','name':'ReminderMe','description':'Financial Empowerment Centers face the following problems:\r\n-Clients failing to return after their first visit.\r\n-Clients forgetting to attend their appointment\r\n-Clients forgetting to reschedule a missed appointment.\r\n-Clients not having proper directions\r\n -Clients that do not bring financial documents.\r\n-Clients that do not know how the financial empowerment centers can help them and what they should expect on their first visit. \r\n\r\nOur project addresses the wish list request regarding appointments and counselor communications. \r\n\r\nThe goal of our project is to help clients build the habit of visiting their Financial Empowerment Center so it can make a real impact on their lives. \r\n\r\nOur project is a comprehensive appointment reminder system that bridges appointment communication between clients and counselors. It is available in English and Spanish. \r\n\r\nOFE counselors use google calendar as their primary method of scheduling appointments. RemindMe automatically pulls appointments from google calendar and sends automated voice calls to clients reminding them of their appointment. \r\n\r\nCounselors first sync their google calendars and phone numbers on our online portal. They also have the option of recording a greeting to be played in the reminder. \r\n\r\nNext, our project will call clients a week before, two days before, and the day of their appointment. \r\nWhen the client receives the call, they hear the pre-recorded greeting from their financial counselor and their appointment time and location. They then have three options to choose from. \r\n\r\nPRESS 1: I can make the appointment\r\nPRESS 2: I have questions\r\nPRESS 3: I need to reschedule\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a client chooses option one, their counselor will receive a text message indicating that their client can make the appointment. If the client has further questions or needs directions, the counselor will also be notified.\r\n\r\nIf the client chooses option two, he/she will hear information about directions, what documents to bring to their appointment, and what financial empowerment centers can offer them. \r\n\r\nIf the client chooses option three, he/she will be redirected to the 311 call center to reschedule their appointment. Their counselor will be notified of the change via a text message.','submitted_at':'2013-03-03T19:07:21Z','total_hackers':2,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/financial-empowerment-hackathon/hacks/reminderme','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/51339f697cf1d315fd00006e/original.png?1362337667','external':'http://www.hitchhikerventures.com/slide/introduction/index.html','demo':''}},{'id':'51326505870728446b0000f0','name':'Virtual Financial Empowerment Center','description':'Allows financial counselors to quickly identify how stable a client is on its transactions, savings and credit activities and allows then to quickly send trick and trips depending on the Client type and the target population.','submitted_at':'2013-03-02T20:45:57Z','total_hackers':3,'urls':{'self':'http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/financial-empowerment-hackathon/hacks/virtual-financial-empowerment-center','screenshot':'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague/hacks/screenshots/51326505870728446b0000f0/original.png?1362338587','external':'https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=4874ce506c5164d8#!/view.aspx?cid=4874ce506c5164d8&resid=4874ce506c5164d8%21987&app=powerpoint','demo':''}}]},{'id':'512fda72fd31fb51b0000002','name':'Berlin Geekettes Hackathon','slug':'berlin-geekettes-hackathon','description':'Berlin Geekettes first all-women hackathon.

Organizations like Atlanta Regional Commission and MARTA are already getting into the Hackathon spirit by posting up some of their biggest challenges. Not just for developers, this hackathon is open to anyone who wants to learn more about innovation, how to effectively crowdsource innovation and how to rapidly solve business problems. Sessions for entrepreneurs on how to Pitch Like a Champion and how to effectively utilize new media are designed to give entrepreneurs real skills not sales pitches. For organizations that attend, we will be giving sessions how to take rapid innovation skills back to your organization to get more out of your development dollar. The fun starts Monday Feb 25th at 8am at Hypepotamus in Midtown and Concludes Feb 28th at 5pm at the Fed in Midtown.  Reserve your seat today!\r\n\r\nSounds Awesome, Whats Cleanweb?\r\n\r\nCleanweb is the application of web/mobile/social business models to the issues of energy, transit, resource constraints and climate change. Cleanweb apps sometimes focus on sharing resources like ViaCycle’s bike sharing program or sometimes they make life more accessible like optimized transit routes between MARTA, the Atlanta Beltline and Midtown.  A Hackathon is a short collaborative innovation session designed to rapidly develop new ideas and implementations. Usually teams form around common interests, develop a reasonable goal, and devise a plan to use their team’s skills to reach that goal in the time allowed. The time constraint forces teams to “make it work” instead of “make it perfect”, and adds a bit of excitement.\r\n\r\nMEETUP! -> Join our meet up this Wens (2/13) at noon at Hypepotamus and dont miss our Happy Hour Blowout Meetup on 2/20!\r\n\r\nShow & Tell @ the FED in Midtown!\r\nTickets Going Fast and are Almost Sold Out! \r\n\r\nWe have an amazing show and tell event planned on Feb 28th starting at 5pm at the Federal Reserve in Midtown.

This map is interactive, and the user is able to effectively visualize the entire nonprofit sector segmented by the service they are providing.  We believe this map will allow users to observe larger nonprofit trends within regions, and provide information on where service redundancies are happening relative to needs.  Additionally, we have integrated a cell scraping platform to this map, which functions as both a data collector and a query search engine i.e. a client texts in a need, such as homeless.  This need appears on the large map in an  aggregated heat map for future analyses.  From this text, the user receives all services directed to homeless populations within a 5 mile radius.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this project allows nonprofits to reach a greater user base, and clientele to have more effective access to services.
