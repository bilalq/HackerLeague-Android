#Hacker League Android

##Description
Our application uses the [HackeLeague](https://www.hackerleague.org) API to present a view of all hackathons past, present, and future that have been run by HackerLeague.  The signed in user is also presented with a condensed view of their own person information.  Individual hackathons can be explored in more detail as well as the hacks that were created at said hackathon.

##Using our Application
As of now there is no official support from HackerLeague for any sort of authentication on a user by user basis, so we built the app with our specific accounts in mind.  To login use the username 'bilalq' and the password 'password'.  From there the application is broken down in a very easy to understand format that is navigable down to individual hacks.

##Plans for the Future
We plan on actively developing this application into the future to continue to add functionality we would like to have.  Hopefully we can get better support for users in the future and start allowing users to enter information into the Hacker League ecosystem instead of just reading from it.
